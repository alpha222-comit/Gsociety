# --- Uploads ---
# In a real-world scenario, you often ignore user uploads, 
# but for Render's build cache, it's sometimes okay to include the folder structure.
# We will leave it out of gitignore for now as our `static/uploads` is currently empty.
# If you add test files you don't want on git, you can add this line:
# static/uploads/
